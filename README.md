# nyit-malware

Hello! :~) I used these files to do my 2016 summer REU project on what permissions and intents malicious Android apps are more likely to request or suggest. The code parses manifest files of a dataset of a 1000 Android apps. It makes a CSV file with a 1 if a keyword from INTENTS.txt shows up or 0 if the keyword didn't show up. Keywords are every new line in INTENTS.txt file. 
The workflow is to run renameAll.sh, getManifest.sh (which uses apktool, an open source Github program, to disassemble apps), and finally intentfinder.py.

Fun disassembled bunny:

oh yeah, it is very challenging and time-intensive to do API call graphs, which was my original summer plan for making a great malware classifier. The leading classifier at the time, DREBIN, did some of call graph analysis.
