# nyit-malware

Hello~ :-) This code parses manifest files of a dataset of Android apps. Makes a CSV with 1 if a keyword from INTENTS.txt shows up. Keywords are every new line /n. I used it to do my summer project on what permissions and intents malicious apps are more likely to request.
run renameAll.sh then getManifest.sh then intentfinder.py, might have used apktool to disassemble apktool is open source on github
